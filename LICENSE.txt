Company shall be responsible for any act or omission of Company's Portal Users and of Company's Portal Users' compliance with all of the terms of this Agreement and the Portal User Contract.  Any action or breach by any of Company's Portal Users shall be deemed an action or breach by Company and vice versa and Company shall correct any breach made by any of its Portal Users within thirty (30) days of the date of SugarCRM's notice thereof and if Company does not correct such breach, then Company will indemnify, defend and hold SugarCRM harmless from any and all breaches of this Agreement by its Portal Users that are not corrected within such time period.

Any action or breach by any of Company's contractors, agents or Affiliates shall be deemed an action or breach by Company and Company will indemnify and hold SugarCRM harmless from any and all breaches of this Agreement by its contractors, agents and Affiliates.  Company waives all of those defenses that Company may have as to why Company should not be liable for Company's contractors', agents' or Affiliates' acts, omissions and noncompliance with this Agreement.  

(f)	The Company may wish to use software developed by third parties to add functionality to the Software which are licensed under the General Public License Version 3 or the Sugar Public License (such third party programs, "Third Party Plug-Ins" and the licenses for such Third Party Plug Ins are the TPPI Licenses"). SugarCRM approves the use of such Third Party Plug Ins with the Software so long as such use is limited to the internal use by Company in a manner which does not subject  the Software to the terms of the TPPI Licenses.  The Company shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless SugarCRM from any damages arising from the application of TPPI Licenses to the Software. If the use of the Third Party Plug Ins subjects the Software to the TPPI License, it shall be deemed to be a material breach of this Agreement.

1.2	Restrictions.  Company shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) sublicense, resell, rent, lease, distribute, market, commercialize or otherwise transfer rights or usage to: (a) the Software, (b) any modified version or derivative work of the Software created by the Company or for the Company, or (c) any software, either modified or not, licensed under a SugarCRM Public License or the General Public License, for any purpose including timesharing or service bureau purposes; (ii) remove or alter any copyright, trademark or proprietary notice in the Software; (iii) transfer, use or export the Software in violation of any laws or regulations of any government or governmental agency; (iv) use or run on any of Company's or Portal Users' hardware, or have deployed for use, any copy or version of the Software licensed under the Sugar Public License or the General Public License; (v) reverse engineer, decompile or modify any encrypted or encoded portion of the Software; (vi) modify any open source version of SugarCRM's software source code ("Original Code") to develop a separately maintained source code program (the "Forked Software") so that such modifications are not automatically integrated with the Original Code or so that the Forked Software has features not present in the Original Code.  The Software includes modules that report the number of authorized Subscription Users and permits SugarCRM the ability to monitor certain usage of the Software ("Critical Control Software") which is fundamental to the business of SugarCRM.  Notwithstanding the terms of this Agreement, neither the Company nor the Subscription Users may modify any portion of the Critical Control Software.  The violation of this prohibition shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and SugarCRM may immediately terminate this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, during the Subscription Period the Company may continue to use the Software (except for the MSSQL Installer described above) initially provided under this Agreement with the subscription key and use differing databases, web servers or operating systems than the database, web server or operating system initially selected by Company on download or installation of the Software at no charge, subject to Company paying and indemnifying SugarCRM for any additional fees SugarCRM is required to pay a third party as a result of Company's change to differing databases, web servers or operating systems. The MSSQL Installer must be used on a Windows platform. If Company desires to use a non-Windows platform, within a reasonable period of time from SugarCRM's receipt of Company's written request, SugarCRM shall provide Company, free of charge, with the MySQL Installer, the download and use of which shall be subject to the terms set forth on Exhibit A.
